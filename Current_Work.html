<h3>The Tedious Game is fully released, made using PuzzleScript. It is a game similar to Sokoban, a push-block puzzle game. The Tedious Game is named so for two of its levels, which are long levels with repeated actions. The inspiration for those two levels was a Super Mario Maker Level that was made to be the longest level possible. It was extremely tedious.</h3>
